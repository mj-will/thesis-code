# Antenna pattern plots

## Static plots

The static plots used in my actual thesis are produced by running `make static_plots`

## Interactive HTML plots

Interactive versions of the plots can be made using `make html`.

These versions are hosted on chart studio

* [Plus antenna pattern](https://plotly.com/~michael.j.williams/21/)
* [Cross antenna pattern](https://plotly.com/~michael.j.williams/23/)

**Note:** due file size limits on chart studio, the online versions a lower resolution.
